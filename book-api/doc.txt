Book_api 
making a simple api that 
* users can add delete update their data (crude)
* json api response, request

1- first users can register 
2- upon register each user gets assigend a token 
3- token will be stored on user's machine 
4- each subsequent request that requires authentication can be done with token

!! currently tokens do not have refresh function
!! if token is not saved there is no way of way to authenticate that user


api enspoints design :
    register endpoint ---> 
        - takes username 
        - takes password
        - returns message
        - returns access_token if successful

    login endpoint ---> Refresh the token 
        -

    add_book endpoint ---> 
        -

    delete_book endpoint --->
        -
    
    user endpoint ---> Check if user exists
        - takes JWT 
        - returns message
        - returns user
